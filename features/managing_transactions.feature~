  In order to handle my accounts together
  As an accountant
  I want to create a new transaction between accounts

Background: Given User is logged in as nevinemgouda@gmail.com
  And the following accounts exist:
  | account_number| account_name     | account_type | total_amount | balance_type | user_id | 
  | 1             | Cash             | Asset        |              | Debit        | 1       |
  | 2             | loan             | Asset        |              | Debit        | 1       |
